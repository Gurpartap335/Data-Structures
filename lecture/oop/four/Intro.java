/**
 * Hit and trial // experiment
 *
 * An object is an entity that has states and behaviours.
 * State tells us how the object looks or what properties it has.
 * Behaviour tells us what the object does.
 * Dog has states like age color name and behaviour like eating sleeping running
 *
 * An object is also referred to an instance of a class.
 * Instantiating a class means the same thing as creating an object.
 * Memory is allocated in RAM whenever creating a logical object.
 *
 *
 * class define states as instance variables(member variables) and behaviors as instance methods.
 * class don't consume any memory.
 *
 * Encapsulation is process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
 *
 * Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the states and
 * behaviour of a parent object.
 *
 * class allows single, multilevel and hierarchical inheritances.
 * Interface allows multiple and hybrid inheritances.
 *
 * Abstraction: process of selecting essential/relevant information
 * In java, we can achieve abstraction in two ways: abstract class and interface
 *
 * Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
 * Poly : many || morphism : ways to represent
 *
 * In java, as a rule of thumb we make instance variables private and instance methods
 * public.
