/**
 * Linked List - Singly + Doubly + Circular
 *
 * Theory for Linked List
 * In linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements
 * are linked using pointers.
 * They include a series of connected nodes.
 * Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
 *
 * what allows a linked list to have its memory scattered everywhere?
 *
 * Head and Tail pointer
 * The Head pointer keeps track of the starting node of the linked list.
 * Tail pointer point to the end of the linked list.
 *
 * A real-world example of uses of linked list to design a song playlist.
 *
 * Single linked list
 * THe pointer that will point to the first node and last node is there in the stack
 * memory.
 *
 * Types of Linked Lists
 * - Simple Linked list
 * - Doubly Linked List
 * - Circular Linked List
 * - Doubly Circular Linked List
 * - Header Linked List
