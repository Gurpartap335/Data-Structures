 * Linked List - Singly + Doubly + Circular
 *
 * Theory for Linked List

 * are linked using pointers.
 * They include a series of connected nodes.
 * Here, each node stores the data and the address of the  next node.
 *
 * Types of Linked Lists
 * - Simple Linked list
 * - Doubly Linked List
 * - Circular Linked List
 * - Doubly Circular Linked List
 * - Header Linked List
