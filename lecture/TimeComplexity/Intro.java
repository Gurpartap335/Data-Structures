What is an time complexity of an algorithm and why is it important?
 The time complexity of an algorithm is the total amount of time required by
 an algorithm to complete its execution.
 The lesser the time complexity, the faster the execution.

Running time depends upon :
1 Single vs multi processor machine
2. Read/write speed to memory
3. 32 bit vs 64 bit

4. Input (only matters)
rate of growth of time of an algorithm wrt the input.
