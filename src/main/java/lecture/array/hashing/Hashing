Index mapping (or direct addressing, or a trivial hash function) in computer
science describes using an array, in which each position corresponds to a key
in the universe of possible values.[1] The technique is most effective when the
universe of keys is reasonably small, such that allocating an array with one
position for every possible key is affordable. Its effectiveness comes from the
fact that an arbitrary position in an array can be examined in constant time.
