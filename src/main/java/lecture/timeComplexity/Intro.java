What is a time complexity of an algorithm and why is it important?
Rate at which time taken increases with respect to the input size.

Time Complexity != time taken

1. Always count TC in worst case scenario Big O Notation
2. avoid constant
3. avoid lower values

Big-O -> upper bound
Omega -> lowest bound


Space Complexity
Auxiliary space(space that you take to solve the problem) +
input space (space that you take to store problem input)

If you create an array of size n int[n] arr
O(n) is the space complexity.

Never do anything to input
