Sorted lists are permutations of their original lists.

Permutations: number of ways things can be ordered or arranged.

Different ways to classify a Sorting Algorithm:
- time complexity
- space complexity(memory usage)
- - in-place algorithm
    directly operates on the input data. 
    original dataset destroyed. less safe
    space-efficient bcz the algo only need a tiny bit of extra space in memory.
- - out-place: don't operate directly on the original dataset instead make new copy of it. safer
- stability
- internal vs external
- recursive vs non-recursive
- comparison vs non comparison

Time Complexity: time consumed by program to run with particular input.
